Restaurant-Togashi-Ramen

This React JS project simulates a website for an Asian restaurant specializing in ramen. It displays a variety of dishes with detailed descriptions of their ingredients, highlighting if they contain spicy elements or if they are suitable for vegetarians or vegans. Upon selecting a dish and refreshments, the site offers the option to dine in the restaurant, pick up the order, or request a home delivery service. It even allows adding or removing products before order confirmation. The website also provides simulated contact information, schedules, location, social media links, and a gallery of kitchen images.
